# Pendulum
Project Title  : Pendulum Velocity Calculator
Description:
This C++ program calculates the maximum velocity of a pendulum based on user-provided inputs such as length, mass, optional radius, and optional gravity. The results are then plotted using gnuplot.

Features:

User Input: Prompts the user for pendulum parameters (length, mass, optional radius, and optional gravity).
Velocity Calculation: Computes the maximum velocity using the small-angle approximation formula.
Data Display: Outputs the calculated data for each pendulum.
Plotting: Utilizes gnuplot to generate a graph of max velocity vs. length.
Usage:
Compilation: Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
User Interaction: Follow the prompts to input the pendulum parameters. You can add multiple pendulums.
Plot Generation: After entering the data, gnuplot will generate a plot displaying the maximum velocities against their respective lengths.


Dependencies:

gnuplot: Ensure gnuplot is installed and available in the system PATH.


How to Contribute: Feel free to fork this repository, make improvements, and create a pull request. Contributions are welcome!

(PS : you have a node.js file attached to have a stimulation of the pendulum)
